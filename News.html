                    <br /> Let's talk about fake news!
                    <br /> You have to pay attention to some elements in order to identify a fake news: 1. Title, fake news has captivating headlines, with capitalized words and many exclamation and question marks, the goal is in fact to attract the
                    reader and earn from click-baiting; 2. Reference, you should always control the issuing site, it should be a web site that you know, safe and trustworthy, if you aren't sure about that, you can control if the news is reported on
                    other web sites; 3. Errors, web sites that publish fake news often have many typos in the text and a strange layout; 4. Dates, you should always control the date of publication of a news item; 5. If you are in doubt, you can control
                    the news in sites that unmask fake news such as Bufale.net and Butac.it in italian.
