                    Fake news and disinformation have always existed, but perhaps it was the pandemic and all tha derived from it that made us fully understand how dangerous they can be. Valentina Petrini in "Non chiamatele fake news" develves into the phenomenon of disinformation,
                    of the manipulation of news. She does it through research, interviews, studies, data and she also transpires a lot of curiosity and desire to understand. She talks about the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccines, climate crisis deniers,
                    conspiracy theories, social media, immigration and politics. All of this is happening today.
