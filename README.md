# What is The Meaning Of?

The Meaning Of was born as an [instagram page ](https://www.instagram.com/_themeaningof_ "instagram page ")in September 2020. 
My sister and I have decided to mix our skills together to create an online place where users could find easy-to-read information on everything related to current events and on some psychological aspects of our life. My sister is in fact a psychologist and she uses The Meaning Of to spread her knowledge to our online community, while I use my skills, adquired thanks to a job as editor for an online newspaper almost two years ago, to write and explain current events to our followers.
Now, The Meaning Of counts more than 900 followers and it is still growing.

## Why did I choose to create The Meaning Of web site?

The Meaning Of web site can be very useful to involve more users and makes us known by even more people. In addition, people can access our information on current events and psychology from the web and not just from instagram. This new online presence can also define our identity even more.

## How is it composed? 

I have created six html pages: the first one is the Home Page, where there are our presentations and our photos; the second one is the News Page, where I have summarized the two most important informative posts for now (the Decree of 23rd of December and general information on how to recognize a fake news); the third one is the Psychology Page, where I have put two videos of my sister explaining some psychological aspects about the best education to give to children and the five phases of mourning. In the Psychology Page, there is also another link that brings the users to another html page, the Form, where they can write to 
the psychologist and ask her what they want: on Instagram, our format "Ask to Psy" is very famous and useful for many people. The last two html pages are Books Pills and Latest Posts: in Books Pills, I have written the presentation of two books that we recommend, while in Latest Posts I have summarized the two latests posts that we have published on Instagram.
I have created a footer, where I have put the current year with Javascript, a contact and an Instagram logo that brings the user directly to our page.
Then, with CSS, I have chosen the style of my web site and the colors: yellow, symbol of knowledge and intellect, and blue, color of calm and security.
In conclusion, I have made the web site responsive to make it adapt to every size of screen.

## What is my long-term plan for managing the interested people?

The web site can be very useful for our online community: it must always be updated with the latest news and I may add an extended version of the instagram posts, through new articles every week. Our online presence could be even bigger: I may create a Facebook page and a Youtube profile, to add new informative videos every month. Then, the web site should be easily found with Google, so I could buy a domain. In addition, I could also create a newsletter with exclusive content to involve even more our online community.
