                    What you should do if you are a close contact of a Covid-19 case and if you have no symptoms (in Italy):
                    <br /> If you have three doses of covid vaccine or two doses for less than four months: no quarantine but you have to wear the FFP2 mask (self-monitoring). To exit self-monitoring, you need a negative swab after at least five days or on the fourteenth day without a swab.
                    <br /> If you have two doses of covid vaccine for more than four months: five days of quaratine plus a negative swab (or fourteen days of quarantine without a swab).<br /> If you are not vaccinated: ten days of quarantine plus a negative swab (or fourteen days of quarantine without a swab). If you have some doubts, contact us in the email below or go on our Instagram page (click on the symbol below).

                    What would you like to eliminate from your life in 2022?
                    <br /> This is what we have asked to our followers on Instagram, thinking about the arrival of the new year. The answers were different from each other: "The thoughtfulness that I put in some light moments", "The judgment on myself",
                    "The misunderstandings with my daughter", "Procrastinating, a big flaw of mine!", "My emotional dependence", "My insecurities, I am working on it", "I want to end an unhealthy relationship", "My fear of making mistakes" and so
                    on. Have you thought about it? If you want to answer, we are waiting for you on Instagram, click on the symbol below!
