                    What is the best education to give to children?
                    <br />
                    Diana Beumrind has identified three parenting educational styles:
                    1. The permissive: parents who do not give rules and children who are very free to do and say what they want.
                    2. The authoritarian: rules are important, family structure is hierarchical, children are obedient.
                    3. The authoritative: rules are explained, children are seen as persons and not as property, there are permissiveness and authority together.
                    Different studies have identified the authoritative style as the most effective for the well-being of the child, who remains free to be himself but without being in disarray.

                    Bereavement as a process:
                    <br />
                    Mourning involves five very difficult phases theorized by the Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler Ross: 1. Denial; 2. Anger; 3. Bargaining: in this phase the person begins to think to accept mourning; 4.Depression and reorganization: the person realizes what happened and tries to reorganize his life; 5. Acceptance: anger and sadness decrease amd emptiness and resignation remain. The last stage allows the person to start living a reorganized life. 
                    These phases can mix or overlap with each other. In addition, the time to process a bereavement is very subjective, but studies say it can be around nine months to a year.
